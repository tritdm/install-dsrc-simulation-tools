<p><h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:result-recording"/>12.1 Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>OMNeT++ provides built-in support for recording simulation results, via
<i>output vectors</i> and <i>output scalars</i>. Output vectors are
time series data, recorded from simple modules or channels. You can use
output vectors to record end-to-end delays or round trip times of packets,
queue lengths, queueing times, module state, link utilization, packet
drops, etc. -- anything that is useful to get a full picture of what
happened in the model during the simulation run.

<p>Output scalars are summary results, computed during the simulation and
written out when the simulation completes. A scalar result may be an
(integer or real) number, or may be a statistical summary comprised of
several fields such as count, mean, standard deviation, sum, minimum,
maximum, etc., and optionally histogram data.

<p>Results may be collected and recorded in two ways:

<p><ol>
  <li> Based on the signal mechanism, using declared statistics;
  <li> Directly from C++ code, using the simulation library
</ol>

<p>The second method has been the traditional way of recording results. The
first method, based on signals and declared statistics, was introduced in
OMNeT++ 4.1, and it is preferable because it allows you to always record the
results in the form you need, without requiring heavy instrumentation or
continuous tweaking of the simulation model.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:signals-and-statistics"/>12.1.1 Using Signals and Declared Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:signals-and-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>This approach combines the signal mechanism (see
<a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signals">[4.14]</a>) and NED properties (see
<a href="chap3.html#sec:ned-lang:properties">[3.12]</a>) in order to de-couple the generation of
results from their recording, thereby providing more flexibility in what to
record and in which form. The details of the solution have been described
in section <a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signal-based-statistics">[4.15]</a> in detail; here we
just give a short overview.

<p>Statistics are declared in the NED files with the <tt>@statistic</tt> property,
and modules emit values using the signal mechanism. The simulation framework
records data by adding special result file writer listeners to the signals.
By being able to choose what listeners to add, the user can control what to
record in the result files and what computations to apply before recording.
The aforementioned section <a href="chap4.html#sec:simple-modules:signal-based-statistics">[4.15]</a>
also explains how to instrument simple modules and channels for signals-based
result recording.

<p>The signals approach allows for calculation of aggregate statistics (such as the
total number of packet drops in the network) and for implementing a warm-up
period without support from module code. It also allows you to write
dedicated statistics collection modules for the simulation, also without
touching existing modules.

<p>The same configuration options that were used to control result recording
with <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cOutVector.html">cOutVector</a></tt> and <tt>recordScalar()</tt> also work when utilizing
the signals approach, and there are extra configuration options to make
the additional possibilities accessible.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:direct-result-recording"/>12.1.2 Direct Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:direct-result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>With this approach, scalar and statistics results are collected in class
variables inside modules, then recorded in the finalization phase via
<tt>recordScalar()</tt> calls. Vectors are recorded using
<tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cOutVector.html">cOutVector</a></tt> objects. Use <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cStdDev.html">cStdDev</a></tt> to record summary statistics
like mean, standard deviation, minimum/maximum, and histogram-like classes
(<tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cHistogram.html">cHistogram</a></tt>, <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cPSquare.html">cPSquare</a></tt>, <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cKSplit.html">cKSplit</a></tt>) to record the
distribution. These classes are described in sections
<a href="chap7.html#sec:sim-lib:statistics">[7.9]</a> and <a href="chap7.html#sec:sim-lib:result-recording">[7.10]</a>.
Recording of individual vectors, scalars and statistics can be enabled or
disabled via the configuration (ini file), and it is also the place to set
up recording intervals for vectors.

<p>The drawback of recording results directly from modules is that result
recording is hardcoded in modules, and even simple requirement changes
(e.g. record the average delay instead of each delay value, or vice versa)
requires either code change or an excessive amount of result collection
code in the modules.

<p>

<p><h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:config-results"/>12.2 Configuring Result Collection<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:config-results" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:result-file-names"/>12.2.1 Result File Names<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:result-file-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Simulation results are recorded into <i>output scalar files</i> that
actually hold statistics results as well, and <i>output vector
files</i>. The usual file extension for scalar files is <tt>.sca</tt>, and
for vector files <tt>.vec</tt>.

<p>Every simulation run generates a single scalar file and a vector file.
The file names can be controlled with the <b><tt>output-vector-file</tt></b>
and <b><tt>output-scalar-file</tt></b> options. These options rarely need
to be used, because the default values are usually fine. The defaults
are:

<pre class="inifile">
output-vector-file = "${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.vec"
output-scalar-file = "${resultdir}/${configname}-${runnumber}.sca"
</pre>
<p>
Here, <tt>${resultdir}</tt> is the value of the <b><tt>result-dir</tt></b>
configuration option which defaults to <tt>results/</tt>, and
<tt>${configname}</tt> and <tt>${runnumber}</tt> are the name of
the configuration name in the ini file (e.g. <tt>[Config PureAloha]</tt>),
and the run number. Thus, the above defaults generate file names
like <tt>results/PureAloha-0.vec</tt>, <tt>results/PureAloha-1.vec</tt>,
and so on.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
  In OMNeT++ 3.x, the default result file names were <tt>omnetpp.vec</tt> and
  <tt>omnetpp.sca</tt>, and scalar files were always appended to, rather than
  being overwritten as in the 4.x version. When needed, the old behavior
  for scalar files can be turned back on by setting
  <tt>output-scalar-file-append=true</tt> in the configuration.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:disabling-result-items"/>12.2.2 Enabling/Disabling Result Items<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:disabling-result-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The recording of simulation results can be enabled/disabled at multiple levels
with various configuration options:

<p><ul>
  <li> All recording from a <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> can be enabled/disabled together
        using the <b><tt>statistic-recording</tt></b> option;
  <li> Recording of a scalar or a statistic object can be controlled with the
        <b><tt>scalar-recording</tt></b> option;
  <li> Recording of an output vector can be controlled with the <b><tt>vector-recording</tt></b>
        option;
  <li> Recording of the bins of a histogram object can be controlled with the
        <b><tt>bin-recording</tt></b> option.
</ul>

<p>All the above options are boolean per-object options, thus, they have similar syntaxes:

<p><ul>
<li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;statistic-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>statistic-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
<li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;scalar-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>scalar-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
<li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;vector-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>vector-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
<li> <i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;histogram-name&gt;.</i><b><tt>bin-recording</tt></b><tt> = true/false</tt>
</ul>

<p>For example, all recording from the following statistic

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[queueLength](record=max,timeavg,vector);
</pre>
<p>
can disabled with this ini file line:

<pre class="inifile">
**.queueLength.statistic-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
When a scalar, vector, or histogram is recorded using a <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b>,
its name is derived from the statistic name, by appending the recording
mode after a semicolon. For example, the above statistic will generate 	the
scalars named <tt>queueLength:max</tt> and <tt>queueLength:timeavg</tt>, and the
vector named <tt>queueLength:vector</tt>. Their recording can be individually
disabled with the following lines:

<pre class="inifile">
**.queueLength:max.scalar-recording = false
**.queueLength:timeavg.scalar-recording = false
**.queueLength:vector.vector-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
The statistic, scalar or vector name part in the key may also contain
wildcards. This can be used, for example, to handle result items with
similar names together, or, by using <tt>*</tt> as name, for filtering by
module or to disable all recording. The following example turns off
recording of all scalar results except those called <tt>latency</tt>, and those
produced by modules named <tt>tcp</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
**.tcp.*.scalar-recording = true
**.latency.scalar-recording = true
**.scalar-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
To disable all result recording, use the following three lines:

<pre class="inifile">
**.statistic-recording = false
**.scalar-recording = false
**.vector-recording = false
</pre>
<p>
The first line is not strictly necessary. However, it may improve runtime
performance because it causes result recorders not to be added, instead of
adding and then disabling them.

<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:configuring-recording-modes"/>12.2.3 Selecting Recording Modes for Signal-Based Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:configuring-recording-modes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Signal-based statistics recording has been designed so that it can be
easily configured to record a &#8220;default minimal&#8221; set of results, a
&#8220;detailed&#8221; set of results, and a custom set of results (by modifying
the previous ones, or defined from scratch).

<p>Recording can be tuned with the <b><tt>result-recording-modes</tt></b>
per-object configuration option. The &#8220;object&#8221; here is the statistic,
which is identified by the full path (hierarchical name) of the module or
connection channel object in question, plus the name of the statistic
(which is the &#8220;index&#8221; of <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property, i.e. the name in
the square brackets). Thus, configuration keys have the syntax
<i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;statistic-name&gt;.</i><tt>result-recording-modes=</tt>.

<p>The <b><tt>result-recording-modes</tt></b> option accepts one or more items as value,
separated by comma. An item may be a result recording mode (surprise!), and
two words with a special meaning, <tt>default</tt> and <tt>all</tt>:

<p><ul>
<li> A <i>result recording mode</i> means any item that may occur in the
      <tt>record</tt> key of the <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property; for example,
      <tt>count</tt>, <tt>sum</tt>, <tt>mean</tt>, <tt>vector((count-1)/2)</tt>.
<li> <b><tt>default</tt></b> stands for the set of non-optional items from
      the <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property's <tt>record</tt> list, that is, those
      without question marks.
<li> <b><tt>all</tt></b> means all items from the <b><tt>@statistic</tt></b> property's
      <tt>record</tt> list, including the ones with question marks.
</ul>

<p>The default value is <tt>default</tt>.

<p>A lone &#8220;-&#8221; as option value disables all recording modes.

<p><i>Recording mode</i> items in the list may be prefixed with &#8220;+&#8221; or
&#8220;-&#8221; to add/remove them from the set of result recording modes. The
initial set of result recording modes is <tt>default</tt>; if the first item
is prefixed with &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221;, then that and all subsequent items are
understood as modifying the set; if the first item does not start with with
&#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221;, then it replaces the set, and further items are understood
as modifying the set.

<p>This sounds more complicated than it is; an example will make it clear.
Suppose we are configuring the following statistic:

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[foo](record=count,mean,max?,vector?);
</pre>
<p>
With the following the ini file lines (see results in comments):

<pre class="inifile">
**.result-recording-modes = default  # --&gt; count, mean
**.result-recording-modes = all      # --&gt; count, mean, max, vector
**.result-recording-modes = -        # --&gt; none
**.result-recording-modes = mean     # --&gt; only mean (disables 'default')
**.result-recording-modes = default,-vector,+histogram # --&gt; count,mean,histogram
**.result-recording-modes = -vector,+histogram         # --&gt; same as the previous
**.result-recording-modes = all,-vector,+histogram  # --&gt; count,mean,max,histogram
</pre>
<p>
Here is another example which shows how to write a more specific option
key. The following line applies to <tt>queueLength</tt> statistics of
<tt>fifo[]</tt> submodule vectors anywhere in the network:

<pre class="inifile">
**.fifo[*].queueLength.result-recording-modes = +vector  # default plus vector
</pre>
<p>
In the result file, the recorded scalars will be suffixed with the recording mode,
i.e. the mean of <tt>queueingTime</tt> will be recorded as <tt>queueingTime:mean</tt>.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:warmup-period"/>12.2.4 Warm-up Period<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:warmup-period" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The <b><tt>warmup-period</tt></b> option specifies the length of the initial
warm-up period. When set, results belonging to the first <i>x</i> seconds
of the simulation will not be recorded into output vectors, and will
not be counted into the calculation of output scalars.
This option is useful for steady-state simulations. The default is 0s
(no warmup period).

<p>Example:

<pre class="inifile">
warmup-period = 20s
</pre>
<p>

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:refining-warmup-period-handling"/>12.2.4.1 Refining Warm-up Period Handling<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:refining-warmup-period-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Warm-up period handling works by inserting a special filter, a <i>warm-up
period filter</i> into the filter/recorder chain if a warm-up period is requested.
This filter acts like a timed switch: it discards values during the specified warm-up
period, and allows them to pass through afterwards.

<p>OMNeT++ allows you to disable the automatic adding of warm-up filters by
specifying <tt>autoWarmupFilter=false</tt> in the <tt>@statistic</tt> as an attribute,
and manually placing such filters (<tt>warmup</tt>) instead.

<p>Why is this necessary? By default, the filter is inserted at the front of the
filter/recorder chain of every statistic. However, the front is not always the
correct place for the warm-up period filter. Consider for example, computing the
number of packets in a (compound) queue as the difference between the number of
arrivals and departures from the queue. This can be achieved using
<tt>@statistic</tt> as follows:

<pre class="ned">
@signal[pkIn](type=<a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cPacket.html">cPacket</a>);
@signal[pkOut](type=<a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cPacket.html">cPacket</a>);
@statistic[queueLen](source=count(pkIn)-count(pkOut);record=vector);
</pre>
<p>
When a warm-up period is configured, the necessary warm-up period filters are
inserted right before the <i>count</i> filters. This can be expressed as the
following expression for the statistic's <tt>source</tt> attribute:

<pre class="ned">
count(warmup(pkIn)) - count(warmup(pkOut))
</pre>
<p>
which is apparently incorrect, because the <i>count</i> filters only start
counting when the warm-up period is over. Thus, the measured queue length will
start from zero when the warm-up period is over, even though the queue might not
be empty! In fact, if the first event after the warm-up period is a departure,
the measured queue length will even go negative.

<p>The right solution would be put the <tt>warmup</tt> filter at the end, like so:

<pre class="ned">
warmup(count(pkIn)-count(pkOut))
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the correct form of the queue length statistic is the following:

<pre class="ned">
@statistic[queueLen](source=warmup(count(pkIn)-count(pkOut));
                     autoWarmupFilter=false;
                     record=vector);
</pre>
<p>

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:warmup-period-manual-result-recording"/>12.2.4.2 Manual Result Recording<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:warmup-period-manual-result-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Results recorded via signal-based statistics automatically obey the warm-up
period setting, but modules that compute and record scalar results
manually (via <tt>recordScalar()</tt>) need to be modified so that they take
the warm-up period into account.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
When configuring a warm-up period, make sure that modules that compute and
record scalar results manually via <tt>recordScalar()</tt> actually obey the
warm-up period in the C++ code.
</ul>

<p>The warm-up period is available via the <tt>getWarmupPeriod()</tt> method of
the simulation manager object, so the C++ code that updates the corresponding
state variables needs to be surrounded with an <i>if</i> statement:

<p>Old:

<pre class="cpp">
dropCount++;
</pre>
<p>
New:

<pre class="cpp">
if (simTime() &gt;= getSimulation()-&gt;getWarmupPeriod())
    dropCount++;
</pre>
<p>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:vector-recording-intervals"/>12.2.5 Output Vectors Recording Intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:vector-recording-intervals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The size of output vector files can easily reach several gigabytes,
but very often, only some of the recorded statistics are
interesting to the analyst. In addition to selecting which vectors to
record, OMNeT++ also allows one to specify one or more collection intervals.

<p>The latter can be configured with the <b><tt>vector-recording-intervals</tt></b>
per-object option. The syntax of the configuration option is
<i>&lt;module-path&gt;.&lt;vector-name&gt;.</i><tt>vector-recording-intervals=</tt><i>&lt;intervals&gt;</i>,
where both <i>&lt;module-path&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;vector-name&gt;</i> may
contain wildcards (see <a href="chap10.html#sec:config-sim:wildcards">[10.3.1]</a>).
<i>&lt;vector-name&gt;</i> is the vector name, or the name string of the
<tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cOutVector.html">cOutVector</a></tt> object. By default, all output vectors are turned
on for the whole duration the simulation.

<p>One can specify one or more intervals in the <i>&lt;startTime&gt;..&lt;stopTime&gt;</i>
syntax, separated by comma. <i>&lt;startTime&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;stopTime&gt;</i> need
to be given with measurement units, and both can be omitted to denote
the beginning and the end of the simulation, respectively.

<p>The following example limits all vectors to three intervals, except
<tt>dropCount</tt> vectors which will be recorded during the whole
simulation run:

<pre class="inifile">
**.dropCount.vector-recording-intervals = 0..
**.vector-recording-intervals = 0..1000s, 5000s..6000s, 9000s..
</pre>
<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:vector-eventnum-recording"/>12.2.6 Recording Event Numbers in Output Vectors<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:vector-eventnum-recording" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>A third per-vector configuration option is <b><tt>vector-record-eventnumbers</tt></b>,
which specifies whether to record event numbers for an output vector.
(Simulation time and value are always recorded. Event numbers are needed
by the Sequence Chart Tool, for example.) Event number recording is enabled
by default; it may be turned off to save disk space.

<pre class="inifile">
**.vector-record-eventnumbers = false
</pre>
<p>
If the (default) <tt>cIndexedFileOutputVectorManager</tt> class is used to
record output vectors, there are two more options to fine-tune its resource
usage. <tt>output-vectors-memory-limit</tt> specifies the total memory that
can be used for buffering output vectors. Larger values produce less
fragmented vector files (i.e. cause vector data to be grouped into larger
chunks), and therefore allow more efficient processing later.
<tt>vector-max-buffered-values</tt> specifies the maximum number of values to
buffer per vector, before writing out a block into the output vector file.
The default is no per-vector limit (i.e. only the total memory limit is in
effect.)

<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:saving-parameters-as-scalars"/>12.2.7 Saving Parameters as Scalars<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:saving-parameters-as-scalars" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>When you are running several simulations with different parameter
settings, you will usually want to refer to selected
input parameters in the result analysis as well -- for example when
drawing a throughput (or response time) versus load (or network
background traffic) plot. Average throughput or response time numbers
are saved into the output scalar files, and it is useful for the input
parameters to get saved into the same file as well.

<p>For convenience, OMNeT++ automatically saves the iteration variables
into the output scalar file if they have numeric value, so they can
be referred to during result analysis.

<p><ul class="warning"><b>WARNING</b><br>
    If an iteration variable has non-numeric value, it will not be recorded
    automatically and cannot be used during analysis. This can happen
    unintentionally if you specify units inside an iteration variable list:
<pre class="inifile">
**.param = exponential( ${mean=0.2s, 0.4s, 0.6s} )  #WRONG!
**.param = exponential( ${mean=0.2, 0.4, 0.6}s )    #OK
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Module parameters can also be saved, but this has to be
requested by the user, by configuring <tt>param-record-as-scalar=true</tt> for the
parameters in question. The configuration key is a pattern that
identifies the parameter, plus <tt>.param-record-as-scalar</tt>. An example:

<pre class="inifile">
**.host[*].networkLoad.param-record-as-scalar = true
</pre>
<p>
This looks simple enough, however there are three pitfalls:
non-numeric parameters, too many matching parameters, and
random-valued volatile parameters.

<p>First, the scalar file only holds numeric results, so non-numeric
parameters cannot be recorded -- that will result in a runtime
error.

<p>Second, if wildcards in the pattern match too many parameters, that
might unnecessarily increase the size of the scalar file. For example,
if the <tt>host[]</tt> module vector size is 1000 in the example below, then the
same value (3) will be saved 1000 times into the scalar file, once for
each host.

<pre class="inifile">
**.host[*].startTime = 3
**.host[*].startTime.param-record-as-scalar = true  # saves "3" once for each host
</pre>
<p>
Third, recording a random-valued volatile parameter will just save a
random number from that distribution. This is rarely what you need, and
the simulation kernel will also issue a warning if this happens.

<pre class="inifile">
**.interarrivalTime = exponential(1s)
**.interarrivalTime.param-record-as-scalar = true  # wrong: saves random values!
</pre>
<p>
These pitfalls are quite common in practice, so it is usually better
to rely on the iteration variables in the result analysis.
That is, one can rewrite the above example as

<pre class="inifile">
**.interarrivalTime = exponential( ${mean=1}s )
</pre>
<p>
and refer to the <tt>$mean</tt> iteration variable instead of the
interarrivalTime module parameter(s) during result analysis.
<tt>param-record-as-scalar=true</tt> is not needed, because iteration variables are
automatically saved into the result files.

<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:outputfile-precision"/>12.2.8 Recording Precision<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:outputfile-precision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Output scalar and output vector files are text files, and floating point
values (<tt>double</tt>s) are recorded into it using <tt>fprintf()</tt>'s
<tt>"%g"</tt> format. The number of significant digits can be configured
using the <b><tt>output-scalar-precision</tt></b> and <b><tt>output-vector-precision</tt></b>
configuration options.

<p>The default precision is 12 digits. The following has to be considered when
setting a different value:

<p>IEEE-754 doubles are 64-bit numbers. The mantissa is 52 bits, which is
roughly equivalent to 16 decimal places (52*log(2)/log(10)). However, due
to rounding errors, usually only 12..14 digits are correct, and the rest is
pretty much random garbage which should be ignored. However, when you
convert the decimal representation back into a <tt>double</tt> for result
processing, an additional small error will occur, because 0.1, 0.01, etc.
cannot be accurately represented in binary. This conversion error is
usually smaller than what that the <tt>double</tt> variable already had
before recording into the file. However, if it is important, you can
eliminate this error by setting the recording precision to 16 digits or
more (but again, be aware that the last digits are garbage). The practical
upper limit is 17 digits, setting it higher doesn't make any difference in
<tt>fprintf()</tt>'s output.


Errors resulting from converting to/from decimal representation can be
eliminated by choosing an output vector/output scalar manager class
which stores <tt>double</tt>s in their native binary form.
The appropriate configuration options are <b><tt>outputvectormanager-class</tt></b>
and <b><tt>outputvectormanager-class</tt></b>. For example,
<tt>cMySQLOutputScalarManager</tt> and <tt>cMySQLOutputScalarManager</tt>
provided in <tt>samples/database</tt> fulfill this requirement.

<p>However, before worrying too much about rounding and conversion errors,
consider the <i>real</i> accuracy of your results:

<p><ul>
  <li> In real life, it is very difficult to measure quantities (weight, distance,
     even time) with more than a few digits of precision. What precision
     are your input data? For example, if you approximate inter-arrival
     time as <i>exponential(0.153)</i> when the mean is really
     <i>0.152601...</i> and the distribution is not even exactly exponential,
     you are already starting out with a bigger error than rounding can cause.

<p>  <li> The simulation model is itself an approximation of real life. How much
     error do the (known and unknown) simplifications cause in the results?
</ul>

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:omnetpp-result-file-format"/>12.3.1 The OMNeT++ Result File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:omnetpp-result-file-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>By default, OMNeT++ saves simulation results into textual, line-oriented files.
The advantage of a text-based, line-oriented format is that it is very
accessible and easy to parse with a wide range of tools and languages, and
still provides enough flexibility to be able to represent the data it
needs to (in contrast to e.g. CSV). This section provides an overview of
these file formats (output vector and output scalar files); the precise
specification is available in the Appendix (<a href="chap28.html#cha:result-file-formats">[28]</a>).


By default, each file contains data from one run only.

<p>Result files start with a header that contains several attributes of the
simulation run: a reasonably globally unique run ID, the network NED type
name, the experiment-measurement-replication labels, the values of
iteration variables and the repetition counter, the date and time, the host
name, the process id of the simulation, random number seeds, configuration
options, and so on. These data can be useful during result processing, and
increase the reproducibility of the results.

<p>
Vectors are recorded into a separate file for practical reasons: vector
data usually consume several magnitudes more disk space than scalars.

<p>
<h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:output-vector-files"/>12.3.1.1 Output Vector Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:output-vector-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>All output vectors from a simulation run are recorded into the same file.
The following sections describe the format of the file, and
how to process it.

<p>An example file fragment (without header):

<pre class="filelisting">
...
vector 1   net.host[12]  responseTime  TV
1  12.895  2355.66
1  14.126  4577.66664666
vector 2   net.router[9].ppp[0] queueLength  TV
2  16.960  2
1  23.086  2355.66666666
2  24.026  8
...
</pre>
<p>
There two types of lines: vector declaration lines (beginning with the word
<tt>vector</tt>), and data lines. A <i>vector declaration line</i>
introduces a new output vector, and its columns are: vector Id, module of
creation, name of <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cOutVector.html">cOutVector</a></tt> object, and multiplicity (usually 1).
Actual data recorded in this vector are on <i>data lines</i> which begin
with the vector Id. Further columns on data lines are the simulation time
and the recorded value.

<p>
Since OMNeT++ 4.0, vector data are recorded into the file clustered by
output vectors, which, combined with index files, allows much more
efficient processing. Using the index file, tools can extract particular
vectors by reading only those parts of the file where the desired data are
located, and do not need to scan through the whole file linearly.

<p>
<h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:scalar-result-files"/>12.3.1.2 Scalar Result Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scalar-result-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>Fragment of an output scalar file (without header):

<pre class="filelisting">

scalar "lan.hostA.mac" "bytes sent"   64869
scalar "lan.hostA.mac" "bytes rcvd"   3529448
...
</pre>
<p>
Every scalar generates one <tt>scalar</tt> line in the file.

<p>Statistics objects (<tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cStatistic.html">cStatistic</a></tt> subclasses such as <tt><a href="../api/classomnetpp_1_1cStdDev.html">cStdDev</a></tt>)
generate several lines: mean, standard deviation, etc.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:sqlite-result-files"/>12.3.2 SQLite Result Files<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:sqlite-result-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Starting from version 5.1, OMNeT++ contains experimental support for
saving simulation results into SQLite database files. The perceived advantage
of SQLite is existing support in many existing tools and languages (no need to
write custom parsers), and being able to use the power of the SQL language
for queries. The latter is very useful for processing scalar results, and less
so for vectors and histograms.

<p>To let a simulation record its results in SQLite format, add the following
configuration options to its <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>:

<pre class="inifile">
outputvectormanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputVectorManager"
outputscalarmanager-class="omnetpp::envir::SqliteOutputScalarManager"
</pre>
<p>
<ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Alternatively, to make SQLite the default format, recompile OMNeT++ with
<tt>PREFER_SQLITE_RESULT_FILES=yes</tt> set in <tt>configure.user</tt>.
(Don't forget to also run  <tt>./configure</tt> before <tt>make</tt>.)
</ul>

<p>The SQLite result files will be created with the same names as textual
result files. The two formats also store exactly the same data, only in
a different way (there is one-to-one correspondence between them.) The
Simulation IDE and <tt>scavetool</tt> also understand both formats.

<p><ul class="hint"><b>HINT</b><br>
If you want to get acquainted with the organization of SQLite result
files, exploring one in a graphical tool such as SQLiteBrowser or SQLite
Studio should be a good start.

<p><h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:scavetool"/>12.3.3 Scavetool<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scavetool" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<!--scavetool-->

<p>OMNeT++'s <tt>opp_scavetool</tt> program is a command-line tool for exploring,
filtering and processing of result files, and exporting the result in formats
digestible by other tools.

<p><h4><a name="sec:ana-sim:scavetool:commands"/>12.3.3.1 Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:scavetool:commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p><tt>opp_scavetool</tt>'s functionality is grouped under four commands:
<tt>query</tt>, <tt>export</tt>, <tt>index</tt>, and <tt>help</tt>.

<p><ul>

<p><li> <b>query</b>: Query the contents of result files. One can list
    runs, run attributes, result items, unique result names, unique module
    names, unique configuration names, etc. One can filter for result types
    (scalar/vector/histogram), and by run, module name, result name and value,
    using match expressions. There are various options controlling the format
    of the output (group-by-runs; grep-friendly; suppress labels; several
    modes for identifying the run in the output, etc.)

<p><li> <b>export</b>: Export results in various formats. Results can be filtered
    by run, module name, result name and more, using match expressions. Output
    vectors can be cropped to a time interval. Several output formats are
    available: CSV in two flavours (one for machine consumption, and a more
    informal one for human consumption via loading into spreadsheet programs),
    OMNeT++ output scalar/vector file (default), OMNeT++ SQLite result file, and
    JSON (again two flavours: one strictly adhering to the JSON rules, and
    another one with slightly more relaxed rules but being also more
    expressive). All exporters have multiple options for fine-tuning the output.

<p><li> <b>index</b>: Generate index files (.vci) for vector files. Note that this
    command is usually not needed, as other scavetool commands automatically create
    vector file indices if they are missing or out of date (unless indexing is
    explicitly disabled.) This command can also be used to rebuild a vector file
    so that data are clustered by vectors for more efficient access.

<p><li> <b>help</b>: Prints help. The synopsys is <tt>opp_scavetool help &lt;topic&gt;</tt>,
    where any command name can be used as topic, plus there are
    additional ones like <tt>patterns</tt> or <tt>filters</tt>. <tt>scavetool
    &lt;command&gt; -h</tt> also works.

<p></ul>

<p>The default command is <tt>query</tt>, so its name may be omitted on the
command line.

<h2><a name="sec:ana-sim:python"/>12.4 Result Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>The recommended way of analyzing simulation results is using the
<i>Analysis Tool</i> in the <i>Simulation IDE</i>. The Analysis Tool
provides a comfortable user interface for selecting result files to work with,
browsing their contents, selecting results of interest from them, and creating
plots. The resulting plots and their underlying data can be exported
in several formats, both for individual charts and in batches. You can choose
from several chart types, and new ones can also be created.

<p>Charts in the Analysis Tool are powered by Python. The Python scripts underlying
the various charts are open for the user to view and edit, so arbitrary logic
and computations can be implemented. Visualization may use the IDE's native
plotting widgets, but it can also be done with Matplotlib. The use of Matplotlib
allows virtually limitless possibilities for visualization.<br><ul><font size=-1>[Note that
Matplotlib also has extensions like Seaborn, Canopy, HoloViews, etc., which can
also be used in chart scripts, further expanding the set of possibilities.]</font></ul> The IDE's
own plotting widgets are more limited in functionality, but they are much more
scalable than Matplotlib.

<p><ul class="note"><b>NOTE</b><br>
Note the terminology. Although the nouns <i>chart</i> and <i>plot</i> are
almost interchangeable in everyday speech, we assign related but clearly
distinct meanings to them when discussing OMNeT++ result analysis. By
<i>chart</i> we essentially mean a Python script with its associated metadata
and parameterization that serves as a "recipe" for producing a plot; and the
word <i>plot</i> is used to refer to the graphics which appears as the result
of running said script.
</ul>

<p>Chart scripts can also be used outside the IDE. Those saved as part of the IDE's
analysis files (<tt>.anf</tt>) can be viewed or run using the <tt>opp_chartool</tt>
command-line program. You can also take advantage of result processing
capabilities in standalone Python scripts. When chart scripts run outside the IDE,
native plotting widgets are "emulated" using Matplotlib.

<p>The Analysis Tool is covered in detail in the User Guide. The following sections
deal with the programming API.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:python_packages"/>12.4.1 Python Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:python_packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Chart scripts heavily build on the following, fairly standard Python packages:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>NumPy</i>: We use NumPy for its efficient representation of numeric
    arrays and the operations on them.
  <li> <i>Pandas</i>: Pandas <tt>DataFrame</tt>s are used for representing and
    manipulating simulation results.
  <li> <i>Matplotlib</i>: For creating the actual plots.
</ul>

<p>OMNeT++ adds the following packages:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.results</i>: Provides access to the simulation
    results for the chart script. The results are returned as Pandas
    <tt>DataFrame</tt>s of various formats.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.chart</i>: Provides access to the properties of the
    current chart for the chart script.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.ideplot</i>: This module is the interface for displaying
    plots with the IDE's native plotting widgets. The API is intentionally very
    close to <tt>matplotlib.pyplot</tt>, which facilitates porting scripts across
    the two APIs. When a chart script runs outside the context of a native
    plotting widget, such as when run from <tt>opp_charttool</tt>, the functions
    are emulated with Matplotlib.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.utils</i>: A collection of utility function for data
    manipulation and plotting, built on top of <tt>DataFrame</tt>s and the <tt>chart</tt>
    and <tt>plot</tt> packages from <tt>omnetpp.scave</tt>.
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.vectorops</i>: Contains operations that can be
    applied to output vectors.
</ul>

<p>An additional module:

<p><ul>
  <li> <i>omnetpp.scave.analysis</i>: Provides support for reading and writing
   analysis (anf) files from Python, and running chart scripts in them for display,
   image export or data export.
</ul>

<p>These packages are documented in detail in Appendix <a href="chap30.html#cha:chart-api">[30]</a>.

<p>
<h3><a name="sec:ana-sim:example_chart_script"/>12.4.2 An Example Chart Script<a class="headerlink" href="#sec:ana-sim:example_chart_script" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>Since information on NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib can be found in abundance
online, and a reference of the <tt>omnetpp.scave.*</tt> Python packages is in the
Appendix, it makes little sense here to go through the functionality they
provide. Instead, in this section we walk through an actual chart script in
order to see how it looks in practice.

<p>The chosen chart script is that of the bar chart. It is quite representative, so
it will prepare you to understand other chart scripts, modify them for custom
needs, or write your own; yet it is short and simple, so it is easy to follow.
We are going to list the source, and pause for explanations after every few lines.

<p><pre class="cpp">
from omnetpp.scave import results, chart, utils
</pre>

<p>The first lines is for importing the packages we are going to use. This is
necessary because nothing is imported by default when the chart script starts.

<p>Notice how all imported modules are under the <tt>omnetpp.scave</tt> module, and not
directly from <tt>numpy</tt> or <tt>pandas</tt> or <tt>matplotlib</tt> packages. This is
because almost all necessary functionality is already encompassed in convenience
methods in (mostly) the <tt>utils</tt> and <tt>plot</tt> modules.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# get chart properties
props = chart.get_properties()
</pre>

<p>Then, we obtain the properties of the bar chart from the <tt>chart</tt> module.
The <tt>props</tt> object we get is a Python <tt>dict</tt> whose entries can be
influnced by the chart properties dialog, and they serve as parameters for
the chart script and the resulting plot.

<p>Try adding <tt>print(props)</tt> to the code, or <tt>for k,v in props.items():
print(repr(k), "=", repr(v))</tt> for fancier output. After the chart script ran,
you should see an output similar to the following:

<pre class="commandline">
'confidence_level' = '95\%'
'filter' = 'type =~ scalar AND name =~ channelUtilization:last'
'grid_show' = 'true'
'legend_prefer_result_titles' = 'true'
'title' = ''
'legend_show' = 'true'
'matplotlibrc' = ''
...
</pre>
<p>
Many entries should look familiar. Indeed, most of the entries have direct
correspondence to widgets in the <i>Chart Properties</i> dialog in the IDE.
Note that all values are strings.

<p><pre class="cpp">
utils.preconfigure_plot(props)
</pre>

<p>The <tt>preconfigure_plot()</tt> call is a mandatory part of a chart script, and
its job is to ensure that visual properties take effect in the plot. Note that
we will also have a <tt>postconfigure_plot()</tt> call, because some properties
must be set before, and others after the plotting.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# collect parameters for query
filter_expression = props["filter"]
include_fields = props["include_fields"] == "true"
</pre>

<p>Here we obtain the result query string from the properties. The query string
selects the subset of the results that serve as input to the chart from the set of
all results loaded from the result files. The <tt>"filter"</tt> property is
common to almost all chart types.

<p>Since bar charts work with scalars, we provide the user an opportunity to select
whether the fields (such as <tt>:mean</tt>, <tt>:count</tt>, <tt>:sum</tt>, etc.) of vector,
statistics, and histogram results should also be included in the source dataset,
as scalars.

<p><pre class="cpp">
# query scalar data into dataframe
try:
    df = results.get_scalars(filter_expression, include_fields=include_fields,
             include_attrs=True, include_runattrs=True, include_itervars=True)
except ValueError as e:
    raise chart.ChartScriptError("Error while querying results: " + str(e))
</pre>

<p>Here, <tt>results.get_scalars()</tt> is the most important part. It uses the
<tt>results</tt> module to get the data for the plot. The resulting Pandas
<tt>DataFrame</tt> will have one row for each scalar result. Columns include
<tt>runID</tt> which uniquely identifies the simulation run, <tt>module</tt>,
<tt>name</tt> and <tt>value</tt> which refer to the scalar, and many other columns
that represent metadata such as result attributes, iteration variables and run
attributes: <tt>iaMean</tt>, <tt>numHosts</tt>, <tt>configname</tt>, <tt>datetime</tt>, etc.

<p>Try <tt>print(df)</tt> to print the dataframe contents. You will get something like
this (for brevity, we dropped the less important columns from the output, and
abbreviated the name of the last colum from <tt>repetition</tt>):

<pre class="commandline">
          module                     name     value iaMean numHosts rep.
0   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.156057      1       10    0
1   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.156176      1       10    1
2   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.196381      2       10    0
3   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.193253      2       10    1
4   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.176507      3       10    0
5   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.176136      3       10    1
6   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.152471      4       10    0
7   Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.154667      4       10    1
11  Aloha.server  channelUtilization:last  0.108992      7       10    0
...
</pre>
<p>
Also note in the snippet above that <tt>try...except</tt> was used to catch
exceptions (usually syntax errors in the query), and gracefully report them back
to the user instead of letting a stack trace appear in the console.
Raising a <tt>chart.ChartScriptError</tt> displays the passed message in the plot area.

<p><pre class="cpp">
if df.empty:
    raise chart.ChartScriptError("The result filter returned no data.")
</pre>

<p>If the query matched nothing, let the user know instead of letting them figure out
from the empty plot they get, again, by raising an exception of the appropriate type.

<p><pre class="cpp">
groups, series = utils.select_groups_series(df, props)
</pre>

<p>
The user may fill in the <i>Groups</i> and <i>Series</i> fields of the
<i>Chart Properties</i> dialog to control how to organize the bar chart.
As each field may contain multiple variables (separated by comma), we split
the values to convert them to lists.

<p>If these fields (properties) are left empty, the script tries to find
reasonable values for them. It also detects various misconfiguration cases
(such as nonexisting column names given in, or overlap between, the "groups"
and "series" columns), and report them back to the user. Leaving out these
checks would, in most cases, cause those errors to manifest themselves in
later steps as spurious Pandas exceptions, whose wording often provides
little guidance to the user about what actually went wrong.

<p><pre class="cpp">
confidence_level = utils.get_confidence_level(props)
</pre>

<p>Extract the confidence level requested by the user from the properties.
(<tt>"none"</tt> is the string that the user can select from the combo box in the
dialog to turn off confidence interval computation.)

<p><pre class="cpp">
valuedf, errorsdf, metadf =
    utils.pivot_for_barchart(df, groups, series, confidence_level)
utils.plot_bars(valuedf, errorsdf, metadf, props)
</pre>

<p>At last, we arrive at the important part of the script, which is pivoting and
plotting the data. The <tt>utils.pivot_for_barchart()</tt> function is used for
pivoting, and <tt>utils.plot_bars()</tt> for plotting.

<p>If you add a <tt>print(valuedf)</tt> statement, you can see the result of pivoting:

If the user requested no confidence interval (error bars), <tt>errorsdf</tt> will be <tt>None</tt>.

<p>In this case, the default 95% is used, so <tt>print(errorsdf)</tt> shows this:

<pre class="commandline">

<p>
This dataframe has the exact same structure (column and row headers) as <tt>valuedf</tt>,
only the values are different - they are the half-length of the confidence interval
corresponding to the selected confidence level, so it can be interpreted as a "+/-" range.

<p>The third dataframe, <tt>metadf</tt> contains various pieces of metadata about the results,

<p>Here are just a few columns from it:

<pre class="commandline">
                        measurement        module                      title
iaMean
1      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=1, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
2      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=2, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
3      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=3, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
4      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=4, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
5      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=5, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
7      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=7, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
9      $numHosts=10, $iaMean=9, etc.  Aloha.server  channel utilization, last
</pre>
<p>
This dataframe is used to assemble the legend labels for the series of bars on the plot.
It has the same row headers as <tt>valuedf</tt>, but the column headers are the names of run
and result attributes, and iteration variables. Where multiple different values would have
had to be put into the same cell, only the first one is present, and an "etc." is appended.

<p>Note that in some other types of charts (line charts, histogram charts, etc.), separating
the results into separate dataframes like this is not necessary, as those charts do not do
pivot operations on their results, and the corresponding plots accept data in formats
that can hold the metadata in the same dataframe as the main values to be plotted.

<p>The drawn plot is shown in Figure <a href="chap12.html#fig:ana-barplot">below</a>:

<p>
  <center>
    <img src="ana-barplot.svg">
    <center><div class="caption"><i>Figure: The resulting bar plot, showing confidence interval as error bars</i></div></center>
    <a name="fig:ana-barplot"></a>
  </center>

<p>
<pre class="cpp">
utils.postconfigure_plot(props)
</pre>

<p>This line applies the rest of the visual properties to the plot.

<p><pre class="cpp">
utils.export_image_if_needed(props)
utils.export_data_if_needed(df, props)
</pre>

<p>These lines perform image and data export. Exporting is done by running chart scripts with
certain properties set in order to indicate to the chart script that exporting is requested.

<p>The <tt>utils.export_image_if_needed()</tt> and <tt>utils.export_data_if_needed()</tt> functions
take those flag properties and a lot of other properties related to exporting.
The latter saves the dataframe given to it as argument.

<p>Based on your personal preferences, you may opt to use to a different
environment, language or tool than the IDE's Analysis tool for analysing
simulation results. Here are some of the possibilities:

<p><ul>
  <li> Use your favourite Python editor to write the analysis scripts, using
    the packages mentioned in the previous section.
  <li> A <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> can also be used to write up the analysis
    steps, still using Python and the above packages.
  <li> If your simulations produce a huge amount of data, you might prefer using
    the SQLite result file format which allows you to run queries without
    loading all data into memory. Python also has packages to access SQLite files,
    e.g. <tt>sqlite3</tt>.
  <li> If you prefer <i>GNU R</i> to Python/Pandas, you might use that.
  <li> Or you may go for <i>MATLAB</i> or <i>GNU Octave</i> if you feel at home with them.
  <li> <i>Spreadsheet</i> programs such as Microsoft Excel might be suitable
    if the amount of data allows it. One drawback of using spreadsheets is the
    manual work associated with preparing and reloading data every time
    simulations are re-run.
  <li> A dedicated visual analytics environment such as <i>Tableau</i> might
    be a better choice than spreadsheets.
</ul>

<p>For environments where reading OMNeT++ result files or SQLite result files is
not a real possibility, probably the easiest way to go is to export simulation
results into CSV with <tt>opp_scavetool</tt>. CSV is a universal format that
nearly all tools understand.
