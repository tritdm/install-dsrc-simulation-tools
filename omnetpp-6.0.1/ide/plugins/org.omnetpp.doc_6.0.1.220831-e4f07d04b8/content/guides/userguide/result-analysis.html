<h1>Analyzing the Results</h1>
<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Analyzing the simulation result is a time consuming process. The result
of the simulation is recorded as scalar values, vector values,
histograms, and evaluated parameters. Information about each run, such
as iteration variables, configuration entries, and run attributes, are
also stored. You can then apply statistical methods to extract the
relevant information and to draw a conclusion. This process may include
several steps. Usually you need to filter and transform the data, and
chart the result. Automation is very important here - you do not want to
repeat the steps of recreating charts every time you rerun simulations.</p>
<p>In OMNeT++ 6.x, the statistical analysis tool is integrated into the
Eclipse environment. Querying, processing and plotting the simulation
results is done with Python 3 scripts, using APIs provided by the IDE.
These scripts and APIs rely heavily on the NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
Python packages. Your scripts and settings (i.e. your recipe for finding
results from the raw data) will be recorded in analysis files (.anf) and
will become instantly reproducible. This means that if simulations need
to be rerun due to a model bug or misconfiguration, existing charts need
not be recreated all over again. Simply replacing the old result files
with the new ones will result in the charts being automatically
displayed with the new data.</p>
<p>When creating an analysis, the user first selects the input of the
analysis by specifying file names or file name patterns (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adhoc-*.vec</span></code>). Data in result files are tagged with meta information.
Experiment, measurement and replication labels are added to the result
files to make the filtering process easy. It is possible to create very
sophisticated filtering rules (e.g. all 802.11 retry counts of
host[5..10] in experiment X, where the iteration variable numHost had a
value of 7).</p>
<p>You can open charts from the selected data with one click. The Analysis
Editor supports bar charts, line charts, histogram charts and scatter
charts. Charts are interactive; users can zoom, scroll, and access
tooltips that give information about the data items.</p>
<p>Charts can be customized. Some of the customizable options include
titles, fonts, legends, grid lines, colors, line styles, and symbols.</p>
<p>The charts made in the IDE can also be viewed and exported later
from the command line, using a tool called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opp_charttool</span></code>. Its
usage and operation is detailed in the Simulation Manual.</p>
</section>
<section id="creating-analysis-files">
<h2>Creating Analysis Files</h2>
<p>The usual way of creating an analysis file is to “imitate” opening an OMNeT++
result file by double-clicking it in the <span class="guilabel">Project Explorer</span> view.
Result files cannot be opened directly, so the IDE will offer creating an
analysis file for it instead.</p>
<p>If the result file name looks like the file was created as part of an experiment
or parameter study, the IDE creates an analysis file that includes all result
files from that experiment as input. The variable part of the file name will be replaced by
an asterisk (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>), will be added with both the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.sca</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.vec</span></code> file extension.
For example, double-clicking a file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PureAloha-numHosts=10,iaMean=1-#3.sca</span></code>
will add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PureAloha-*.sca</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PureAloha-*.vec</span></code> to the analysis.</p>
<p>Upon double-clicking, the <span class="guilabel">New Analysis File</span> dialog will open. The
folder and the file name are pre-filled according to the location and name of
the result file. Press <span class="guilabel">Finish</span> to create the new analysis file.</p>
<p>The same dialog is also available from the menu as <span class="menuselection">File ‣ New
‣ Analysis File</span>. However, analysis files created that way will contain no
reference to result files, so file name patterns will need to be added later.</p>

<p>If the analysis file already exists, double-clicking on the result
file will open it.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="opening-older-analysis-files">
<h2>Opening Older Analysis Files</h2>
<p>The format of the analysis files (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.anf</span></code>) has changed in OMNeT++ 6.0 in a
non-backward compatible way, meaning that older OMNeT++ versions will not be
able to open new analysis files. OMNeT++ 6.0, however, attempts to open and
convert analysis files created by older versions. Keep in mind that the
conversion is “best-effort”: the result may be incomplete or incorrect. Always
check that the converted charts indeed correspond to the original ones, and
refine the result if needed.</p>
</section>
<section id="using-the-analysis-editor">
<h2>Using the Analysis Editor</h2>
<p>The usual workflow of result analysis consists of a few distinct steps.
These are: adding input files to the analysis, browsing simulation results
and selecting those of interest, creating a chart of an appropriate type from
the results, then viewing them as plots, and finally exporting data and/or
images if needed.</p>
<p>The Analysis Editor is implemented as a multi-page editor. What the editor
edits is the “recipe”: what result files to take as inputs, and what kind of
charts to create from them. The pages (tabs on the bottom) of the editor
roughly correspond to some of the steps described above.</p>
<p>In the next sections, we will go through the individual pages of the editor,
and which analysis steps can be performed using them.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-inputs-page">
<h2>The Inputs Page</h2>
<p>The first page in the editor is the <span class="guilabel">Inputs</span> page, where you specify
input files for analysis. You can add a set of file name patterns that specify
which result files to load. When the IDE expands the patterns, it displays the
list of matched files under each one. The contents of files are also displayed
in a tree structure.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id3">
<img alt="../_images/ANF-InputsPage.png" src="../_images/ANF-InputsPage.png" />
<figcaption>
<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 119 </span><span class="caption-text">The Inputs page</span></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>New input files can be added to the analysis by dragging vector and scalar files
from the <span class="guilabel">Project Explorer</span> view, or by opening a dialog with the
<span class="guilabel">New Input</span> button on the local toolbar.</p>
<section id="resolution-rules">
<h3>Resolution Rules</h3>
<p>Input file patterns are resolved with the following rules:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>An asterisk (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code>) matches files/folders within a single folder;</p></li>
<li><p>A double asterisk (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**</span></code>) may match multiple levels in the folder hierarchy;</p></li>
<li><p>If the pattern starts with slash (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code>), it is understood as a workspace full path,
with its first component being a project name;</p></li>
<li><p>If the pattern does not start with slash (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/</span></code>),  it is interpreted as
relative to the folder of the analysis file;</p></li>
<li><p>If the pattern identifies a folder, it will match all result files in it
(i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/foo/results</span></code> is equivalent to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/foo/results/**.sca</span></code> plus
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/foo/results/**.vec</span></code>).</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="refresh-files">
<h3>Refresh Files</h3>
<p>The input files are loaded when the analysis file is opened.</p>
<p>If files change on the disk or new files are created while the analysis is open
(for example, because a simulation was re-run), a refresh can be triggered with the
<span class="guilabel">Refresh Files</span> button on the toolbar. <span class="guilabel">Refresh Files</span> expands
the file name patterns again, then loads any new matching files, unloads files
that no longer exist on the disk, and reloads the files that have changed
since being loaded. Open charts are also refreshed.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In the design of the Analysis Tool, it was a conscious choice to opt for
explicit reload in favor of an automatic one. Automatic reload would make it
difficult to look at partial results due to excessive refreshing while a large
simulation campaign is underway, or when a simulation is continually writing
into a loaded vector file.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="reload-files">
<h3>Reload Files</h3>
<p>It is also possible to let the Analysis Tool completely forget all loaded result files,
and have them reloaded from scratch. The functionality is available from the
context menu as <span class="guilabel">Reload All Files</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="are-files-kept-in-memory">
<h3>Are Files Kept in Memory?</h3>
<p>The contents of scalar files <em>are</em> loaded in memory.</p>
<p>Vector files are not loaded directly; instead, a much smaller index file
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.vci</span></code>) is created and the vector attributes (name, module, run, statistics,
etc.) are loaded from the index file. The index files are generated during the
simulation, but can be safely deleted without loss of information. If the index
file is missing or the vector file was modified, the IDE rebuilds the index in
the background.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Progress</span> view displays the progress of the
indexing process if it takes a long time.</p>
</div>
</section>
</section>
<section id="the-browse-data-page">
<h2>The Browse Data Page</h2>
<p>The second page of the Analysis editor displays results (parameters,
scalars, histograms, and vectors) from all files in tables and lets the
user browse them. Results can be sorted and filtered. Simple filtering
is possible with combo boxes, or when that is not enough, the user can
write arbitrarily complex filters using a generic pattern-matching
expression language. Selected or filtered data can be immediately
plotted.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">

<section id="filtering">
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p>Filtering of the table contents is possible with the combo boxes above the
tables. The strings in the combo boxes may contain wildcards, and the combo
boxes also support content assist (<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl+SPACE</kbd>), both of which are useful if
there are a huge number of items with different names.</p>
<p>If a more sophisticated selection criteria is needed, it is possible to switch
to a more generic filter expression. After pressing the <span class="guilabel">Filter
Expression</span> button in the filter row, you can enter an arbitrary filter
expression. The expression language is described in section

<section id="creating-charts">
<span id="ana-creating-charts"></span><h2>Creating Charts</h2>
<p>The following sections walk you through working with charts,
starting from the very basics, all the way to more advanced
topics involving Python scripting.</p>
<p>Charts can be created in two ways: first, based on the set of selected results
on the <span class="guilabel">Browse Data</span> page, and second, choosing from the list of
available chart types on the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page. In the latter case, the
results which serve as input for the chart need to be configured manually, while
in the former case it happens implicitly.</p>
<p>Various types of charts are available. There are a number of
built-in ones, and you can also add your own to your projects.</p>
<p>The Analysis Tools can display plots in two ways: with Matplotlib, and with the
built-in (“native”) plot widgets. The former one makes the full functionality of
Matplotlib available in the IDE (which basically means that you can draw
anything). In contrast, native plot widgets are more limited in functionality,
can only display three types of plots (bar, line, and histogram plot), but they
are also more responsive and much more scalable.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is usually indicated in the name of a chart type whether it is
Matplotlib-based or uses a native plot widget.</p>
</div>
<section id="from-the-browse-data-page">
<span id="ana-plotting-results"></span><h3>From the Browse Data Page</h3>
<p>Most often, a new chart is created from a set of simulation results,
selected on the <span class="guilabel">Browse Data</span> page.</p>
<p>First, select the results you wish to plot. Then, right-clicking on the selected
set of results presents you with a choice of chart templates, showing only those
that accept the given set of results as input.</p>
<figure class="align-default" id="id9">

<p><span class="caption-number">Fig. 125 </span><span class="caption-text">Plotting the selected results</span></p>

</figure>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">Choose from Template Gallery</span> menu item shows
the same filtered list of templates in the gallery dialog (see next section),
where you can see a description with screenshots for each.</p>
<p>Simply double-clicking on a result, or selecting some and pressing
Enter, will also open a suitable chart.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Charts opened this way are not saved into the analysis, i.e. they
will be discarded when you close them. In order to preserve a chart
as part of the analysis, you need to choose <span class="guilabel">Save
Chart</span> from the toolbar or the context menu of the chart’s page.
When you do that, the chart will appear on the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#ana-temporary-charts"><span class="std std-ref">Temporary Charts</span></a> for more info.</p>

<section id="from-the-charts-page">
<h3>From the Charts Page</h3>
<p>Right clicking in an empty area on the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page and opening
the <span class="guilabel">New</span> submenu lists all the available chart templates.
Clicking on one creates a new chart from that template.</p>
<p>The <span class="guilabel">New Chart</span> button on the toolbar opens a gallery-like
dialog, where more information (with a short description and some screenshots)
is shown about each of the chart templates. Selecting one and pressing
<span class="guilabel">OK</span> instantiates that template into a new chart.</p>

<h2>Using Charts</h2>
<p>This section introduces you to the basics of working with charts in the
OMNeT++ IDE. It shows how to navigate on plots, how to configure their
appearance, and export data and images.</p>
<section id="opening-a-chart">
<h3>Opening a Chart</h3>
<p>To open an existing chart, double-click it in the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page, or
select it and hit <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Enter</kbd>.</p>
</section>
<section id="temporary-charts">
<span id="ana-temporary-charts"></span><h3>Temporary Charts</h3>
<p>Temporary charts are created when simulation results are plotted directly from
the <span class="guilabel">Browse Data</span> page. Temporary charts are not part of the analysis,
which means they don’t appear on the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page, and will disappear
when closed (unless saved into the analysis).</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The easiest way to see whether an open chart is a temporary chart is to check
the leftmost icon on the local toolbar. If you see <span class="guilabel">Save Chart</span>,
then it is temporary chart; if you see <span class="guilabel">Go To Chart Definition</span>,
then the chart is part of the analysis (and the button will take you to the
<span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page to show it).</p>
</div>
<p>When you try to close a temporary chart, the IDE will ask whether you want to
save it into the analysis.</p>
<p>On saving a temporary chart, it is recommended that you check the filter
expression on the <span class="guilabel">Inputs</span> page of the chart configuration dialog, and
refine or simplify it as needed. When the temporary chart is created, the IDE
generates a filter expression based on the selection, but the generated
expression is not always optimal, and it may not accurately express your
intended selection criteria.</p>
</section>
<section id="navigation">
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>In an open chart, the mouse pointer has two different operation modes in the plot area. In Pan mode, you
can scroll with the mouse wheel and drag the chart. In Zoom mode, the user can
zoom in on the chart by left-clicking and zoom out by doing a
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> plus left-click, or using the mouse wheel. Dragging selects a rectangular
area for zooming. The toolbar icons and switch between Pan and Zoom modes.
You can also find toolbar buttons to zoom in, zoom out and zoom to fit.
Zooming and moving actions are remembered in the navigation history.</p>
<p>The navigation of Matplotlib charts is slightly different from this,
as that follows how Matplotlib charts usually handle navigation.
One addition compared to that is that scrolling, <kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Shift</kbd> plus scrolling and
<kbd class="kbd docutils literal notranslate">Ctrl</kbd> plus scrolling pans vertically/horizontally, or zooms. There is also
a third mode, called interactive mode, which is used to manipulate
interactive elements on the plot, such as widgets, if present.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-chart-properties-dialog">
<h3>The Chart Properties Dialog</h3>
<p>Charts have a set of properties that define their behavior and looks.
These properties can be edited in a configuration dialog, accessible
from the <span class="guilabel">Configure Chart</span> toolbar button and context menu item.</p>
<p>The dialog has a tabbed layout, where the list of tabs and the form on each page
differ for each chart type. Pages that are common to nearly all chart types
(albeit with slightly differing contents) are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="guilabel">Input</span>: Defines what results simulation results should be used
as input for the chart, and their roles (e.g. which ones to use for the
horizontal axis, iso lines, etc).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="guilabel">Plot</span>, <span class="guilabel">Lines</span>, <span class="guilabel">Bars</span>, etc: For configuring the labels, markers, ticks, grid, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="guilabel">Styling</span>: Visual properties for the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="guilabel">Advanced</span>: Lets you manually add custom plot properties that don’t occur on the other pages.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="guilabel">Export</span>: Properties to be used during image/data export.</p></li>

<span id="ana-filter-expression"></span><h3>Filter Expressions</h3>
<p>Filter expressions are used at multiple places in the Analysis Tool, e.g. for
filtering the table/tree contents on the <span class="guilabel">Browse Data page</span>, and on
<span class="guilabel">Input</span> pages of chart properties dialogs for selecting simulation
results as input for the chart.</p>
<p>A filter expression is composed of terms that can be combined with the <cite>AND</cite>,
<cite>OR</cite>, <cite>NOT</cite> operators, and parentheses. A term filters for the value of some property of
the item, and has the form <cite>&lt;property&gt; =~ &lt;pattern&gt;</cite>, or simply <cite>&lt;pattern&gt;</cite>. The latter
is equivalent to <cite>name =~ &lt;pattern&gt;</cite>.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The following properties are available:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>name</cite>: Name of the result or item.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>module</cite>: Full path of the result’s module.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>type</cite>: Type of the item. Value is one of: <cite>scalar</cite>, <cite>vector</cite>, <cite>parameter</cite>, <cite>histogram</cite>, <cite>statistics</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p><cite>isfield</cite>: <cite>true</cite> is the item is a synthetic scalar that represents a field of statistic or a vector, <cite>false</cite> if not.</p></li>

<h3>Vector Operations</h3>
<p>The charts that show vector results offer a selection of operations
to transform the data before plotting.</p>
<p>These can be added to the chart under the <span class="guilabel">Apply</span> or
<span class="guilabel">Compute</span> context menu items.
Both ways of adding operations compute new vectors from existing
ones. The difference between them is that Apply replaces the original
data with the computation result, while Compute keeps both.</p>
<p>Some operations have parameters that can be edited before adding it,
in the confirmation dialog that pops up after selecting the operation.</p>
<p>Most operations perform a fairly simple transformation on each individual
vector independently: summation, windowed average, etc. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expression</span></code>
facilitates a more complex, freeform computation in one go. And two exceptions
are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aggregate</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">merge</span></code>, as these operate on the entire DataFrame,
combining multiple vectors into one.</p>
<p>For example, see the screenshots illustrating the effects of the following
vector operations:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">apply</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">sum</span>

<h3>Exporting Data</h3>
<p>Both the input data used by a chart, and the final result after any processing,
can be exported.</p>
<p>The first one is essentially the same as the result exporting option on the
<span class="guilabel">Browse Data</span> page, except that it uses the result filter expression
of the given chart to select which results to export. This is available under the
<span class="guilabel">Export Chart Input As</span> context menu item of charts.</p>
<p>The second one includes any transformations the chart might perform on the data
before plotting it, and is available under the common <span class="guilabel">Export Chart</span>

<h3>Exporting Images</h3>
<p>There are multiple, significantly different ways of exporting a chart to an image:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can copy the chart to the clipboard by selecting <span class="guilabel">Copy to
Clipboard</span> from the context menu. The chart is copied as a bitmap image the
same size as the chart on the screen, taking the current navigation state into
account.</p></li>
<li><p>The <span class="guilabel">Save Image</span> option saves the currently shown part of the chart
to an image file. Popular raster and vector formats are accepted, including
PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF, TIFF, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the <span class="guilabel">Export Chart</span> option opens the common
image/data exporting dialog (see section <a class="reference internal" href="#ana-batch-export"><span class="std std-ref">Batch Export</span></a>) for this
chart only. This option relies on the chart script for doing the actual
exporting. (It runs the chart script  in the background, asking it to perform
the export.)</p></li>

<section id="customizing-charts">
<h2>Customizing Charts</h2>
<p>All charts are powered by Python scripts, which take their configuration
settings from properties that can be edited in the <span class="guilabel">Chart
Configuration</span> dialog. All of these elements are under your full control so that
you can create exactly the plots that you need for your analysis: you can edit
the chart script, you can edit the properties using the configuration dialog,
and you can also modify/tweak the configuration dialog itself to add input
fields for extra properties, for example. Each chart has its own copy of
everything (the chart script, properties and config dialog pages), so modifying
one chart will not affect other similar charts.</p>
<section id="editing-the-chart-script">
<h3>Editing the Chart Script</h3>
<p>To see or edit the chart’s Python script, click the <span class="guilabel">Show Code Editor</span>
button on the toolbar of an open chart. With the code editor open, you are free
to make any changes to the chart’s script.</p>
<p>The integrated editor is that of the PyDev project. It provides syntax
highlighting, code navigation (go to definition, etc.), helpful tooltips (using
docstrings), and content assist (completion suggestions).</p>

<section id="refreshing">
<h3>Refreshing</h3>
<p>Normally, the chart script is automatically re-executed with some delay after
each edit. This functionality can be enabled/disabled using the
<span class="guilabel">Automatic Refresh</span> button on the chart page toolbar. Independent of
the auto-refresh state, you can always trigger a manual refresh (re-execution of
chart script) by pressing the <span class="guilabel">Refresh</span> on the toolbar. If the chart
script execution takes too long, you can abort it by clicking the
<span class="guilabel">Kill Python Process of the Chart</span> button on the toolbar.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>The viewport (zoom/pan state) is usually preserved after refresh. If the area
occupied by the displayed data changes significantly for some reason, it is
possible that you will see an empty plot after the refresh, simply because
valuable content now falls outside the viewport. Push the <span class="guilabel">Home</span>
icon on the toolbar in these cases to bring all plotted elements into view.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="console-output">
<h3>Console Output</h3>
<p>The console output of the script, i.e. text written to the <em>stdout</em> and <em>stderr</em>
streams, is displayed in the <span class="guilabel">Console</span> view. Each chart has a console
of its own in the view, which is activated when switching to the chart’s page in
the editor. Text written to the standard error stream appears in red. You can
write to the console using Python’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print()</span></code> statement. Notably,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print(df)</span></code> is a very useful line that you’ll probably end up using quite often.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Even though PyDev offers a variety of tools for debugging Python scripts,
these unfortunately don’t work on chart scripts. Limited debugging can be
performed using print statements, throwing exceptions, and dumping stack traces,
which is usually enough. If you really need debugging to get a piece of code
working, one way is to factor out the code to be able to run independently,
and use an external debugger (or the IDE’s debugger) on the resulting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> file.</p>

<section id="errors">
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>Errors are marked in the source code with a red squiggle and a sidebar icon.
Hover over them to see a tooltip describing the error. The errors are also
entered into the <span class="guilabel">Problems</span> view. Double clicking these problem
entries will reveal the line in the code editor where the error came from.
Errors marked this way include Python syntax errors, and runtime errors which
manifest themselves in the form of Python exceptions. For exceptions, the
stack trace is printed in the <span class="guilabel">Console</span> view.</p>

<h3>Editing Dialog Pages</h3>
<p>If you need to add support for new configuration properties to the chart, you
will need to edit the forms on the <span class="guilabel">Configure Chart</span> dialog. Pages
(tabs) in the configuration dialog are represented as XSWT forms. To see or edit
the pages and forms within, click the <span class="guilabel">Edit Dialog Pages</span> button on
the property editor dialog.</p>
<p>The action will bring up the <span class="guilabel">Edit Chart Dialog Pages</span> dialog, which
lets you edit the forms that make up the configuration dialog of the chart.
You can add, remove, reorder and rename tabs, and you can edit the XSWT form
on each tab. A preview of the edited form is also shown.</p>
<p>XSWT is an XML-based UI description language for SWT, the widget toolkit
of Eclipse on which the OMNeT++ IDE is based. The content of XSWT files
closely mirror SWT widget trees.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:id.default</span></code> provides a default value for the chart property named in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:id</span></code> attribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Further <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:id.*</span></code> attributes are also used, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:id.contentAssist</span></code>
defines the kind of content assist requested for the edit control, or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:id.isEnabler</span></code> denotes a checkbox as the enabler of the widget group

<section id="chart-programming">
<h2>Chart Programming</h2>
<p>Data processing in chart scripts is based on the NumPy and Pandas packages,
with some modules provided by OMNeT++.</p>
<section id="python-modules">
<h3>Python Modules</h3>
<p>The chart scripts can access some functionality of the IDE through a couple of
modules under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">omnetpp.scave</span></code> package.
These include: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chart</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ideplot</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vectorops</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">utils</span></code>.
The complete API of these modules is described in the Simulation Manual.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chart</span></code> module exposes information about the chart object (as
part of the analysis, and visible on the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page), most
importantly its set of properties, but also its name, and what type
of chart it is.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code> module provides access to the set of result items (and
corresponding metadata) currently loaded in the analysis in the IDE.
This data is accessible through a set of query functions, each taking
a filter expression, and returning a Pandas DataFrame.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ideplot</span></code> module is the interface for displaying plots using the IDE’s
native (non-Matplotlib) plotting widgets from chart scripts. The API is
intentionally very close to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib.pyplot</span></code>. When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ideplot</span></code> is used
outside the context of a native plotting widget (such as during the run of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opp_charttool</span></code>, or in IDE during image export), the functions are emulated
with Matplotlib.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vectorops</span></code> module contains the implementations of the built-in vector
operations.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">utils</span></code> module is a collection of utility functions for processing and
plotting data. Most chart scripts heavily rely on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">utils</span></code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the well known <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">matplotlib</span></code>, and
sometimes the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scipy</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seaborn</span></code> packages are often utilized.
All other packages installed on the system are also fully available.</p>

<section id="tips-and-tricks">
<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
<p>This section is a collection of tips for use cases that might
come up often when working with charts, especially when editing
their scripts.</p>
<section id="sharing-code-among-charts">
<h4>Sharing Code Among Charts</h4>
<p>For future releases, we are planning to support “snippets” as part of the
analysis file, as a means of sharing code among charts. Until that feature is
implemented, a workaround is to put shared code in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code> files.
These scripts can be imported as modules. They will be looked for in the
folder containing the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.anf</span></code> file, and in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python</span></code> folders of the
containing project and all of its referenced projects.
Chart scripts can import these files as modules, and thereby use the
functionality they provide. This also makes it possible to use external
code editors for parts of your code.</p>
</section>
<section id="customizing-the-legend">
<h4>Customizing the Legend</h4>
<p>The order of items appearing in the legend, and in which they are drawn,
is determined by their order in the data used for plotting. They can
therefore be reordered by sorting the rows of the dataframe before plotting it.
For example: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">df.sort_values(by=['iaMean'])</span></code></p>
<p>Normally, labels for the legend are concatenated, using some heuristics, from
columns that best differentiate the data items. If you are not satisfied with
the result, there are two ways to affect it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">comment</span></code> column to the dataframe, its contents will be appended
to the auto-generated legend labels in parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p>If you add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">legend</span></code> column, its contents will be used instead of
auto-generated legend labels, so you can create your own legend labels.
Example:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df[&quot;legend&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">&quot;iaMean=&quot;</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">df[&quot;iaMean&quot;]</span></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="adding-extra-data-items-to-the-plot">
<h4>Adding Extra Data Items to the Plot</h4>
<p>It’s possible to add new data items to the queried results before plotting.
These can be either computed from existing items, or synthesized from a
formula. Example uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Computing derived results:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df[&quot;bitrate&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">df[&quot;txBytes&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">df[&quot;sim-time-limit&quot;]</span></code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding analytical references, like theoretical values in an ideal scenario:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df[&quot;analytical&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">=</span>&#160; <span class="pre">df[&quot;p&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">(1</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">df[&quot;p&quot;])</span> <span class="pre">**</span> <span class="pre">(df[&quot;N&quot;]-1)</span></code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Summarizing results:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df[&quot;mean&quot;]</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">df[&quot;vecvalues&quot;].map(np.mean)</span></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="simplifying-complex-queries">
<h4>Simplifying Complex Queries</h4>
<p>Instead of coming up with an elaborate filter expression, it is sometimes more
straightforward to query results multiple times within a script, and combine
them with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.concat</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.join</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.merge</span></code>. Other functions like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pf.pivot</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.pivot_table</span></code> are also often useful in these cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="defining-new-vector-operations">
<h4>Defining New Vector Operations</h4>
<p>You can define your own vector operations by injecting them into the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vectorops</span></code> module, even if this injection is done in an external module

<h4>Customized Export</h4>
<p>If the built-in image/data exporting facilities are not sufficient for your
use case, you can always add your own export code, either by manually
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open()</span></code>-ing a file, or by utilizing a data exporter library/function of
your liking. Functions such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">plt.savefig()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df.to_*()</span></code> can be
useful for this.</p>
</section>
<section id="caching-the-result-of-expensive-operations">
<h4>Caching the Result of Expensive Operations</h4>
<p>Since the entire chart script is executed on every chart refresh, even if only a
visual property has changed, it can sometimes help to cache the result of some
expensive data querying or processing procedure in the script. And because every
execution is in a fresh Python process, caching can only really be done on the
disk.</p>
<p>There are existing packages that can help you in this, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">diskcache</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cache.py</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">memozo</span></code>. (Note that caching the result of a function call is
often called <em>memoization</em>; using that term in online searches may give you
additional insight.)</p>
<p>If the sequence of operations whose result is cached includes simulation result
querying (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results.get_scalars()</span></code>, etc.), it is important to invalidate
(clear) the cache whenever there is a change in the loaded result files. The
change can be detected calling the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results.get_serial()</span></code> function, which
returns an integer which is incremented every time a result file is loaded,
unloaded or reloaded.</p>

<section id="arbitrary-plot-types">
<h4>Arbitrary Plot Types</h4>
<p>In charts using Matplotlib, the whole range of its functionality is available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Arbitrary plots can be drawn (heatmaps, violin plots, geographical maps, 3D curves, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Advanced functionality like mouse event handlers, graphical effects, animations, and widgets, all works</p></li>
<li><p>It’s also possible to just add small customizations, like annotations</p></li>
<li><p>Any extension library on top of Matplotlib can be used, such as: <em>seaborn</em>, <em>ggplot</em>, <em>holoviews</em>, <em>plotnine</em>, <em>cartopy</em>, <em>geoplot</em></p></li>
<li><p>The built-in plotting capability of Pandas DataFrames (under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df.plot</span></code>) works too</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="per-item-styling-on-native-plots">
<h4>Per-Item Styling on Native Plots</h4>
<p>For native plots, properties affecting individual data items can be specified
with the following additional syntax: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;propertyname&gt;/&lt;itemkey&gt;</span></code>. Unless
overridden manually, the data item keys are sequentially increasing integers,
starting with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code>. For example, adding the following line on the Advanced tab
in the property editor dialog of a line chart will set the color of second line
(or of the line identified with the key <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>) to red.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Line.Color/2</span> <span class="pre">:</span> <span class="pre">#FF0000</span></code></p>

<h2>Custom Chart Templates</h2>
<p>When charts are created, they are instantiated from a template. The list of
available chart templates can be browsed in the template gallery dialog,
available from the <span class="guilabel">Charts</span> page as <span class="guilabel">New Chart</span>, and from
the <span class="guilabel">Browse Data</span> page as <span class="guilabel">Choose from Template Gallery</span>.
The dialog shows some properties (chart type, accepted result types), a
description, and often also sample images for each one.</p>
<p>The IDE contains a number of built-in chart templates, but the user can add
their own, too. Custom chart templates live in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charttemplates</span></code> folder of
every project, and are available in analyses in the same project and all
projects that depend on it.</p>
<section id="exporting-a-chart-as-template">
<h3>Exporting a Chart as Template</h3>
<p>The easiest way of creating a custom chart template is by customizing a chart,
then saving it as a template. The <span class="guilabel">Save as Template</span> option in the
chart’s context menu writes the contents of the given chart into the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">charttemplates</span></code> directory of the project.</p>

<p>You may want to tweak some properties (e.g. the descriptive name) of the saved
chart template before use, but regardless, the new chart template is immediately
available for use.</p>

<section id="parts-of-a-chart-template">
<h3>Parts of a Chart Template</h3>
<p>A chart template consists of several parts, describing the initial contents of
charts created from it: what kind of drawing widget it needs (Matplotlib or one
of the native widgets), what script it executes, how its configuration
dialog looks like, what types of result items it can process/show, and which
icon should be used for it.</p>
<p>Namely, there are several files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;.properties</span></code>: This is the main file file. It defines the name and other
attributes of the chart template, and references all other files by name. The
syntax is Java property file.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;.py</span></code>: The Python file that contains the chart script.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.xswt</span></code>: The dialog pages.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Scripts and dialog pages can be shared by multiple chart templates.</p>
</div>
<p>Notable keys in the properties file:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">id</span></code>: Internal identifier</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code>: Descriptive name</p></li>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scriptFile</span></code>: The chart script Python file</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">icon</span></code>: Icon file, e.g. in PNG format</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">resultTypes</span></code>: One or more of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scalar</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vector</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">parameter</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">histogram</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">statistics</span></code>, separated by comma</p></li>

<section id="under-the-hood">
<h2>Under the Hood</h2>
<p>This section details the internal workings of the Python integration in the
Analysis Tool. Its contents are not directly useful for most users, only for
those who are curious about the technicalities, or want to troubleshoot an issue.</p>
<p>Chart scripts are executed by separate Python processes, launched from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">python3[.exe]</span></code> found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code>. This decision was made so a rogue chart script
can’t make the entire IDE unresponsive, or crash it. Also, it’s possible to
put resource or permission constraints on these processes without hindering the
IDE itself, and can be killed at any time with no major consequences to the rest
of the Analysis Tool - for example, in the event of a deadlock or thrashing.</p>
<p>These processes are ephemeral, a fresh one is used for each refresh,
so no interpreter state preserved across executions. A small number of
processes are kept pre-spawned in a pool, so they can be put to use quickly
when needed.</p>
<p>If you wish to utilize virtual environments, start the entire IDE from a shell
in which the environment to use has been activated. This way the spawned Python
interpreter processes will also run in that environment.</p>
<p>The level of flexibility offered by this arbitrary scripting unfortunately
comes with its own dangers too. Note that the scripts running in charts have
full access to everything on your computer without any sandboxing, so they can
read/write/delete files, open graphical windows, make network connections,
utilize any hardware resources, etc.! Because of this, make sure to only ever
open analysis files from sources you trust! (Or files from untrusted sources
only on systems that are not critical.)</p>
<p>Communication between the Eclipse IDE and the spawned Python processes
is done via the Py4J project, through an ordinary network (TCP) socket.</p>
<p>To avoid the CPU and RAM inefficiencies caused by the string-based nature of
the Py4J protocol, bulk data is transferred in shared memory (POSIX SHM,
or unnamed file mappings on Windows) instead of the socket. Without this,
binary data would have to be base64 encoded, then represented as UTF-16,
which would be about 3x the size on top of the original content, which is
already present in both processes. Data passed this way includes any queried
results (in pickle format), and in the other direction, the data to plot on
native widgets, or the raw pixel data rendered by Matplotlib.</p>
<p>Many other kinds of information, like GUI events or smaller pieces of data
(like chart properties) are passed through the Py4J socket, as regular function
call parameters.</p>
