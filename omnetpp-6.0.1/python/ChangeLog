	* Workspace class: Revised to have a more correct and well-defined handling
	of Eclipse workspaces and projects of the IDE, now with tests. Changes include:

	  - Improved handling of "renamed" projects, i.e. those where the name in
	    the .project file differs from the folder name.

	  - Improved handling of "moved" projects, i.e. those not under the workspace
	    directory. When the main project references such projects, they are now
	    found more reliably. If there is no Eclipse workspace, referenced
	    projects are looked for next to existing known projects.

	  - Better (more informative) error messages if something goes wrong.

	  - Workspace class constructor now accepts workspace_dir=None, for "not known".

      - find_workspace() now returns None if a .metadata directory was not found,
        instead of making up something.

	  - find_enclosing_project() is no longer static.

	path in opp_charttool as well.

2022-04-11  ------ omnetpp-6.0 released ------

2022-03-31  Attila Torok

	* export_image_if_needed(): Use noninteractive MPL backends when exporting
	images, set MPI.

2022-03-29  Attila Torok

	* export_image_if_needed(): Make sure that constant vector data is not
	stuck to the chart edge in case of native chart

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* get_scalars(): do not fail when the result would be empty

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* Analysis: Store/restore mpl.rcParams before/after running a chart

2022-03-30  Attila Torok

	* Fix check of whether image and data export was unsuccessful

2022-03-26  Andras Varga

	* Add __version__=6.0.0 into all scave submodules.

2022-01-26  Attila Torok

	* Delete the now-defunct pure-Python resultloader module for now.
	It wasn't updated to newer scave file format versions.

2022-01-14  Attila Torok

	* Fix the "All" option (minor lines) for grid in ideplot

2022-01-07  Attila Torok

	* utils.py: Rename pick_two_columns() to select_best_partitioning_column_pair()

2022-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Hide internal and imported members of utils.py from generated docs

2022-01-05  Attila Torok

	* Minor tweaks to docstrings in vectorops.py.

	* Add legend customization and docstring to the box-and-whiskers plot

2022-01-03  Attila Torok

	* utils.py docstring updates

2021-12-17  Attila Torok

2021-12-21  Attila Torok

	* utils.py: export: Also allow "=" in sanitized filenames

2021-12-21  Attila Torok

	exist in returned df

2021-12-15  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: utils.py improvements:

	- New functions (factored out from chart scripts): plot_lines(),
	  plot_boxwhiskers(), pivot_for_barchart(), pivot_for_scatterchart(),
	  get_confidence_level()

	- plot_bars(): Accept meta_df, expect data df in transposed form.

2021-12-17  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: vectorops: timeavg: More helpful error message when wrong
	interpolation mode is given

2021-12-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix outside legend placement when exporting native charts

2021-12-15  Attila Torok

	is_native_chart()

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: plot_bars() to accept a meta_df, in order to be able to
	generate better legend and axis labels and plot titles.

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: ChartTemplate.create_chart(): disallow adding properties
	not defined in the chart template

	Note: this uncovers bugs in the scatter chart and other templates: they
	don't define "include_fields", but the chart needs it -> error.

2021-12-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: analysis.py: fix image export when running from a different
	working dir

2021-12-10  Attila Torok

	instead of None.

2021-12-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: ChartTemplate: rename make_chart() to create_chart()

2021-12-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: fix chart.is_native_chart()

2021-12-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix utils.extract_label_columns for the 1 row case,
	blacklist "repetition" because "replication" is nicer.

2021-12-08  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix pick_two_columns in utils, broken by recent
	extract_label_columns changes

2021-11-11  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: added charttemplate.py. Provides functionality
	for loading of chart templates, instantiating charts from chart
	templates, etc.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Print message of exceptions caught from within
	set_observed_column_names.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Raise chart.ChartScriptError from
	utils.assert_columns_exist(). This automatically sets the warning text,
	and tests expect this.

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix set_observed_column_names() in charttool impl
	of chart module. Parameter names have to match with those in the
	interface modules

2021-12-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Improvements in utils.extract_label_columns(),
	make_legend_label() and make_chart_title()

2021-12-06  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix warnings from MPL when computing confidence
	intervals (for bar- and scatterplots)

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Move call of set_observed_column_names() to export_data_if_needed()

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: automatic legend: added "prefer module display path to module
	path" option; dialog and code refactoring

2021-12-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: Fix and improve charttemplates tests

2021-11-29  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: proper error handling for legends

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Introduce ChartScriptError, raise it from chart scripts where
	needed instead of manually setting the plot warning text and calling
	(an alias to) sys.exit(1).

2021-11-30  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Add the timedilation vector operation

2021-11-16  Levente Meszaros

	* omnetpp.scave: Change default of width and height in export_image() to
	None, so that they don't override the properties stored in the chart itself
	when no value is given for these parameters. And there are defaults
	anyway on both the higher and lower levels anyway
	(in the XSWT form, and in export_image_if_needed()).

2021-11-28  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave: chart.py: added set_observed_column_names(). This is
	useful for providing content assist for column names in the legend format
	string.

2021-11-29  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: utils.py: no longer append the optional 'comment'
	df column to the legend. Reason: that feature is not longer needed, because
	we have legend format strings (user can add "$comment" to it if they want)

2021-11-26  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: utils.py: support for legend_format and
	legend_replacements.

2021-11-17  Andras Varga

	* opp_charttool: improved 'info' command; Analysis.info() removed

	- opp_charttool: 'info' command: listing format change
	- opp_charttool: let filtering (-i, -n) apply to the 'info' command too
	- info() moved from Analysis into opp_charttool

2021-11-16  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: Added Folder support to Analysis API

2021-11-10  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.analysis: Minor chart execution fixes.

2021-10-29  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Add digit grouping to tick labels in MPL-emulated
	native charts.

2021-10-26  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Make MPL-emulated native widgets more similar
	to the IDE (axis limits, number format for ticks, etc.)

2021-10-15  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.plot: Restore the omnetpp.scave.plot module for
	compatibility. It falls back to the new omnetpp.scave.ideplot package
	after issuing a warning.

2021-10-11  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: assert_columns_exist() to raise ValueError from
	instead of calling exit() (which a library is not supposed to do).

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: plot_bars(), plot_vectors(), plot_histograms(): Sort
	results by legend label (or indices, for bar charts) before plotting.

2021-10-07  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.utils: Fix: Make legend options work again with non-native charts

2021-10-05  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Rename omnetpp.scave.plot module to omnetpp.scave.ideplot,
	because it better describes its functionality (accessing native plots in the
	IDE).

2021-10-04  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Refactoring: Rename internal package impl_charttool to
	impl, and all modules in it appropriately

2021-10-04  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.results: Remove the `merge_module_and_name` parameter

2021-09-27  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.results: added support for direct loading of result files
	into a dataframe (read_result_files()), and extended query functions so they
	accept that dataframe as input.

2021-07-27  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave.vectorops: Fix example code and docs for crop(), don't try
	to perform movingavg() in-place

2021-06-14  Levente Meszaros, Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: added timewinthruput vector operation

2021-04-20  Attila Torok

	* omnetpp.scave: Vector operations are now registered using the
	@vector_operation decorator

2021-03-25  Andras Varga

	* ChangeLog added
