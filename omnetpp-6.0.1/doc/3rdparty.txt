THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE


The OMNeT++/OMNEST distribution contains several open source components
which are covered by their own licenses. These components are listed below,
together with their web sites where you can find more information and the
source code. We'll discuss these open-source packages in three groups:

  1. Packages used by the OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation runtime
  2. Packages needed by Eclipse-based OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE
  3. Packages bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++ on Windows, as part of the
     compiler tool-chain.

We'd like to thank the open source community for developing and making
these packages available. OMNeT++/OMNEST would not have been possible
without them.


1. Packages used by the OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation runtime
=========================================================

Simulations built with the OMNeT++/OMNEST runtime are using the following
*optional* open source components. It is possible to build a simulation
without them, but with reduced functionality.

MersenneTwister.h
-----------------
Mersenne Twister is a random number generator (RNG), written by Makoto Matsumoto,
Takuji Nishimura, Shawn Cokus and Richard J. Wagner, and distributed under
BSD license.

OMNEST/OMNeT++ uses Mersenne Twister as its default RNG. Plugging in
alternative RNGs and designating them as default RNG is also possible.

Mersenne Twister is part of the OMNEST/OMNeT++ source code.


YXML
----
YXML (https://dev.yorhel.nl/yxml) is a small non-validating XML parser distributed
under the MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

YXML is part of the OMNEST/OMNeT++ source code.


SQLite
------
SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless,
zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The SQLite code is
in Public Domain (https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html)

OMNEST/OMNeT++ uses SQLite to record simulation results in an easily
accessible format.

SQLite is part of the OMNEST/OMNeT++ source code.


SGR macros
----------
SGR macros for ANSI console color sequences, written by YOSHIOKA Takuma,
distributed under the MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

sgr_macro.h is part of the OMNEST/OMNeT++ source code.


Fira Code font
--------------
The Fira Code font (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is embedded in Qtenv
for better readability and distributed under the SIL Open Font License 
(https://scripts.sil.org/OFL).


Qt
--
The Qtenv simulation execution environment is based on Qt, a cross-platform
widget toolkit. The open-source version of Qt is distributed under LGPLv2.1
and LGPLv3 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/). Non-LGPL commercial Qt licenses
are available from The Qt Company (http://www.qt.io).

Qt is needed to run models under the Qtenv GUI. Qt is not used if the
console-based Cmdenv is used. Note that 3D visualization is only available
under Qtenv.

On Linux, the user has to install Qt from the repository; on other
platforms it is bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++.


OpenSceneGraph
--------------
The OpenSceneGraph (openscenegraph.org) is an open source high performance
3D graphics toolkit. OpenSceneGraph is an optional component of Qtenv.
OpenSceneGraph is distributed under the terms of the OpenSceneGraph Public
License (OSGPL), based on LGPL (http://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/about/licensing).

OpenSceneGraph is needed for running models with 3D visualization under the
Qtenv GUI.

On Linux, the user has to install OpenSceneGraph from the repository; on
other platforms it is bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++.


osgEarth
--------
osgEarth (osgearth.org) is a C++ geospatial SDK and terrain engine distributed
under the terms of LGPLv2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

osgEarth is needed for running models with 3D map and terrain visualization
under the Qtenv GUI.

On Linux, the user has to install osgEarth from the repository; on other
platforms it is bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++.


SystemC
-------
SystemC (www.accellera.org) is a C++ library which provides event-driven
simulation capability for system design. It is licensed under the
Apache License v2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses).

SystemC is optional. It is only needed if one wants to run hybrid SystemC-
OMNEST simulations.

SystemC is bundled with OMNEST. It is not bundled with OMNeT++.


LibXML2
-------
LibXML2 (xmlsoft.org) is an open-source XML parser, written by Daniel Veillard.
LibXML2 and ICONV (also a needed component) are distributed under the MIT License.
https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

When a simulation model component has parameters of type XML, OMNeT++/OMNEST
can use this library to parse XML files that contain DTD definitions. If the model
does not make use of XML file validation, this library is not needed and
OMNeT++/OMNEST can use its own built-in XML parser.

On Linux, the user has to install LibXML2 from the repository; on macOS, 
OMNEST/OMNeT++ can use the LibXML2 installation bundled with the OS.
On Windows, it is bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++.


2. Packages needed by the Eclipse-based OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE
==========================================================

The OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE is using the following open source components.
If you don't use the IDE, none of the components below are needed.

Eclipse
-------
The OMNeT++/OMNEST IDE is based on the Eclipse Platform (eclipse.org), and
additional plug-ins, distributed under the EPL (Eclipse Public License).
https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php

Using the IDE is optional. Except for some non-crucial features, all features
of the software are available from the command-line. Models may be developed
using 3rd party text editors and/or C++ IDEs as well.

Eclipse is bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++ on all platforms.


PyDev
-----
PyDev (pydev.org) is an Eclipse plug-in for python development distributed
under the EPL (Eclipse Public License). https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php

distributed under GPLv2 with the Classpath Exception 
(http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html).

The JRE part of OpenJDK is bundled with the OMNEST/OMNeT++ IDE.


Apache Java libraries
---------------------
The IDE internally makes use of some libraries distributed under the
Apache License v2.0 (http://www.apache.org/licenses). These libraries
include several from the Apache Commons project (Lang, Collections, etc),
Apache HttpClient, and others.


XSWT Editor
-----------
XSWT Editor is an Eclipse plug-in for creating XML-based forms, distributed
under the Common Public License (https://opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.php)

3. Packages bundled with OMNEST/OMNeT++ on Windows, as part of the compiler tool-chain
======================================================================================

On Windows (TM), the following components have been bundled with OMNeT++/OMNEST as
part of the compiler tool-chain:

MinGW-w64
---------
MinGW-w64 is a Windows port of gcc, and a minimal Unix-like
environment in which typical makefiles can execute (mingw-w64.org).
